This repository contains the correlation result we found in our study of relationships between socioeconomic factors and natures of disease outbreaks.

-----

Data related to disease outbreak attributes are given in this repository. A list of the values for different attributes is given in pdf form. Links to these are:

* [Disease List](./Diseases.pdf "Disease List")
* [Affected Systems](./AffectedSystems.pdf, "Affected Systems")
* [Carriers](./Carriers.pdf, "Carriers")
* [Regular Symptoms](./RegularSymptoms.pdf "Regular Symptoms")
* [Transmission Methods](./TransmissionMethod.pdf "Transmission Methods")
* [Cure Types](./CureType.pdf "Cure Types")
* [High Risk People](./HighRiskPeople.pdf "High Risk People")
* [Vaccine Availability](./VaccineAvailability.pdf "Vaccine Availability")

All table summaries can be found [here](./all_tables.pdf "Table Summary").

-------------

All 50 indicator buckets can be found [here](./indicator_buckets.md "Indicator Buckets").

-------------

Detailed results, i.e. correlation with individual attributes of the 193 attributes in consideration with a specific disease outbreak attribute can be found in the folders inside the project.

For example, to find out correlations of different socioeconomic factors with outbreaks showing characteristic of affecting the cardiovascular system can be found in: [**AffectedSystems/affected_systems_Cardiovascular.csv**](./AffectedSystems/affected_systems_Cardiovascular.csv).

The same can be done for any of the disease outbreak characteristics.
